  <h2> This is Sam</h2>
  <h3>Founder, Author, and CEO of </h3>
  <p> <em>"that pussy"</em>, also known as
    <em>"The Attempted Understanding of What We Call Living.""</em>...
    also known as <em>"that pussyyyyy".</em></p>
  <p>
    So, I suppose we can start off with my name; it's <em>Sam.</em>
    <br />
    Short for <em>"Samantha"</em> and shorter for <em> Sympathetic, anxious,</em> and (often times) <em> manically </em> depressed. :)
    If I could give myself a new name it would be Erin.
    Someting about classic gender neutral names I like but <em>"Sam"</em> has
    too many hiccups on its back for me to carry it seriously these days.
    I like potato salad, archetecture and <em>that pussy.</em>
